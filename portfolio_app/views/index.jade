            I've been teaching group classes and private lessons for nearly four years, currently out of
            #[a(href="http://www.portlandballroomdancing.com") Uptown Ballroom] in Tigard. Prior to Uptown,
            I co-founded and hosted a twice-monthly social dance for about two years, and taught group classes
            at various places around Portland.
        p.
            My favorite dances are Nightclub Two-Step, West Coast Swing, Cross-Step Waltz, and Hustle.
            I also do a smattering of other dances.

        p.
            Although I don't do it too often these days, my first love was drawing. I spent some time
            as a pet portrait artist, enjoying the delicacy and precision of portraiture combined
            with cute animals. 'Cause cute animals.
        p.
            I like to take an unreasonable number of photos with my Nikon D3000 whenever I go
            somewhere pretty.
