                                I've been teaching group classes and private lessons for nearly four years, currently out of
                                #[a(href="http://www.portlandballroomdancing.com") Uptown Ballroom] in Tigard. Prior to Uptown,
                                I co-founded and hosted a twice-monthly social dance for about two years, and taught group classes
                                at various places around Portland.
                            p.
                                My favorite dances are Nightclub Two-Step, West Coast Swing, Cross-Step Waltz, and Hustle.
                                I also do a smattering of other dances.

                                Although I don't do it too often these days, my first love was drawing. I spent some time
                                as a pet portrait artist, enjoying the delicacy and precision of portraiture combined
                                with cute animals. 'Cause cute animals.
                            p.
                                I like to take an unreasonable number of photos with my Nikon D3000 whenever I go
                                somewhere pretty.
